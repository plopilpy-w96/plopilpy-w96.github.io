# SysBalloons

Message balloons for windows 96.


### JS Syntax

To use SysBalloons in your projects, use the `sb_send()` function.

Here's the syntax for the function:

`sb_send("title", "body", "icon URL")`

The 3rd argument is required. If you don't want an icon URL, set the 3rd argument to `"noicon"` **as a string**. Again, the syntax for a balloon with no icon is: `sb_send("title!", "body!", "noicon")`.

Hope this helps. For any questions, contact me on the Windows 96 Discord.
